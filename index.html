    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p> When i was young i had a keen interest in computer systems and cell phones, and how they function so efficiently and can do some tasks 10 times 
        faster that too with utmost precesion than us. As i grew up i started to read more about them and enquire from my teachers. This is how i
        gradually developed interest in this field. As soon as i graduated from high school , i knew it was time to follow my passion , to design
        captivating websites all from scratch and grow as a web developer.<br/>
        As i am young and full of creativity, and continuously upgrading my skill set and knowledge not just from books or online courses but also from the work of some distinguished personalities , thier trials and errors,
        i belive i will bring great value to the company and customers.
